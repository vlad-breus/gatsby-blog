We're all about A/B testing in data science, right? Touted as the gold standard, it's what every data science interview drills into you: Which metrics? How to design? Success or flop? What could mess it up? Over the last decade, this stuff evolved big time. Back in my day, you had to whip up A/B testing from scratch—every company their own brew, sometimes just winging it through the fog.

Then Ronny Kohavi pops up on LinkedIn, dropping [a take on cohort analysis](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/ronnyk_is-cohort-analysis-useful-i-have-seen-this-activity-7119685152150077440-DNvB?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop) like it’s too messy for A/B testing's crisp sheets. His point? It's all just pretty, meaningless noise without the stats rigor. But then, why do so many in the biz—founders, investors, the lot writing books on data-driven moves—swear by it? Are they clueless, or is Kohavi missing the plot, too caught up in scientism?

Nassim Taleb's got this bit in "Antifragile" about ["Lecturing birds how to fly"](https://www.concentus.com/lecturing-birds-how-to-fly/) — basically, valuing book-smarts over the gritty, real stuff that actually flies. And that's the vibe I get here.

Look, your business's bank account couldn't care less about statistical significance. What matters is the hard cash from real customers, not the math on how likely those numbers came by chance. This whole "statistical significance" spiel is just dressing up for folks who like to feel smart. But if you're bleeding cash faster than you're making it, no amount of statistical sugarcoating's gonna save you.

Don't get me wrong—I'm not bashing A/B testing or saying let's all go back to guessing games. But if the raw data's screaming trouble and your models are humming a lullaby, guess who needs a reality check? Ignoring the noise because it's not pretty by the book might just be the final nail in your business’s coffin.

So here’s the deal: we need to get real with the mess. Business is not a clean lab experiment. It's a wild ride with half-broken tools and gut calls. And sometimes, that's just how you've got to roll—imperfect data, gut feel, and all.

To my data science pals and biz leaders out there: don't get stuck on perfect. Use the tools, but remember they're just that—tools, not gospel. The real world's messy, unpredictable, and it doesn’t pause for your analysis to catch up. Sometimes, making the call with the best you've got is all you can do—and often, it's enough.

In the end, it’s about what works, not what's theoretically flawless. And sometimes, what works is diving into the chaos headfirst, making those calls with whatever you’ve got, and pushing ahead. That’s business, that’s life. Let’s not forget it.
